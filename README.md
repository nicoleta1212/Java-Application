EmployeeSystem


It's a Spring boot application to insert new employees into the system/database, by department, 
with personal data, ID card, address and schedule. There are a series of search methods,
the one that interest us the most is searching the employees that work in a certain location,
within certain hours, in a certain day. The company this is designed for is a facility management one.
